## Project Overview

The Industrial Copper Modeling project is designed to address challenges within the copper industry, such as data skewness, noisy data, and lead classification. We employ machine learning techniques for regression and classification tasks, data preprocessing, and develop an interactive Streamlit application for predicting selling prices and lead statuses.

## Skills Acquired

- Python scripting
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning (Regression and Classification)
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Streamlit for creating a user interface

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset used for modeling.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and Streamlit app development.
- **models**: Saved machine learning models (e.g., regression and classification models) using the `pickle` module.
- **src**: Python scripts with utility functions and preprocessing code.
- **app**: Streamlit application files for creating the user interface.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
